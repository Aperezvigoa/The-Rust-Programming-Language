# The Rust Programming Language ðŸ“˜ðŸ¦€

This repository contains my personal notes, examples, and code as I work through the book [_The Rust Programming Language_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), commonly known as *"the Rust Book"*.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

The goal of this repo is to document my journey learning Rust in a structured, hands-on way. It serves as:
- A personal reference of what I've learned  
- A collection of annotated examples and small experiments  
- A resource others can browse to get a beginner's perspective  

## ðŸ¦€ Why Rust?

- Memory safety without garbage collection  
- Performance comparable to C/C++  
- Powerful type system and error handling  
- Ideal for systems, CLI tools, and backend development  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

If you want to follow along:

1. Make sure you have Rust installed:  
   ðŸ‘‰ https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aperezvigoa/The-Rust-Programming-Language.git
   cd The-Rust-Programming-Language

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

This is a learning repository. Code may be experimental, commented heavily, or reflect work-in-progress understanding.
